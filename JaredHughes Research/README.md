# Project Title
Should the Mets have signed Jared Hughes?

# Motivation
A MLB trade rumors article noted Hughes' high HR/FB ratio last season.
My research compares the Jared Hughes' HR/FB ration over his career with
the average HR/FB of all relievers and then the highest 80th percentile HR/FB of relievers.
