# Project Title
A Heatmap of Strike Call Likelihood

# Motivation
I used Trackman data to model the likelihood of a strike call in different locations. Then I used ggplot to plot a heatmap of the predicted strike call likelihood.
Finally, I created a shiny app to display the heatmap and made it interactive, by allowing the user to adjust certain factors.

# Credits
Shiny Apps was necessary in creating the heatmap.
