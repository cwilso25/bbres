# Title
Can personality predict performance?

# Subtitle
Can personality data found by analyzing tweets be used to predict improvement?

# Motivation
I'm trying to combine my interests in baseball and psychology. According to a paper written by Jennifer Golbeck, Cristina Robles, Michon Edmondson,
and Karen Turner from the University of Maryland entitled "Predicting Personality from Twitter", certain language features in tweets are significantly correlated
with big 5 personality traits. For example, the number of commas used in Tweets is negatively correlated with conscientiousness. Assuming that their research
is accurate, my research attempts to understand if we can reasonably predict a player's personality traits, will those traits correlate with improvements in
performance. For example, if a player is shown to be highly extroverted based on analysis of their tweets, are they more likely to have made large improvements
in his performance over his career. To put my motivation in the simplest terms, I am trying to find the psychological basis for the concept of grit.
